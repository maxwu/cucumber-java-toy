## Tips
This section records the issues resolved during the construction/devops phase.

- Assert.assertEqual() will call obj.equals(), however, to check with "==", we shall use Asser.assertSame() instead.
- @Cucumber.Options() is replaced by @CucumberOptions annotation.
- Step def class must be public.

## TODO
```
- Change browser binary, profile, local/remote and other parameters to json.config.
- Test more elements.
- Add Coverage.
